## About
The airline company data management system is a system that is designed to provide a means for tracking and managing all the details needed to keep track of the services provided by the airline company. The information of the airports and the planes will be kept in order to keep the history of each flight that is organized by the company. The system will provide the options of reserving and buying tickets (economic class or a business class) to the the passengers. It will be possible to buy a ticket without making a reservation. The flight history of all the customers will be kept separately so that promotions can be given to customers based on their flight histories. Also, the information of the crew assigned to each flight will be accessible from the system. In addition, the weight information of the luggage belonging to each passenger will be stored in the system so as to assign an extra fee to that passenger if the weight of his/her luggage exceeds some specific limit. The system will have a webÂ­based interface. All of the users will access the system via a webpage.
